        Meow! I'm XMJ, a lively and adorable 3.5-year-old tabby cat. Weighing
        6kg, I'm full of energy and love running around and playing all day.
        Tasty snacks are my favorite, but nothing makes me happier than being
        with my dear XX and Levi. Whether I'm chasing toys or enjoying delicious
        food, every day is an exciting adventure for me! My life is filled with
        joy and surprises - want to experience it with me?
